        <p>Welcome to the homepage of the Albatross Times. We are committed to bringing
            you the kind of journalistic garbage that Americans have craved every morning for
            the past 30 years.
            <br>
            <br>
            Facts? Who cares about the facts when you <strong>could</strong> be reading
            the stories of glamour and drama
            of people who have the money and power to mess up publicly in the kind of way you <em>dream</em>
            of.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here at the Times, we will let you know exactly when the President uses the West Wing's toilet
            or when some obscure part of the American midwest manages to scrounge up the strangest but juciest
            headlines.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Albatross Times. Your #1 source for the news on the rapidly declining culture of the West.
            Or the stuff to line your birdcage.
